# Cirikoth RP Rules & Guidelines
## _Minecraft 1.18+ Plugin_
#
> Built by: __F4NGDEV__
#

__Cirikoth__ is a Minecraft plugin developed for version 1.18+ that rewires the mechanics of the game for a new experience! It brings the realism of a Medieval-Fantasy life to the minecraft realm you are in. Appoint Jarls to rule your towns/holds and watch as economy, community, and creativity spring to life.

As such, each new player will need to submit for an Interview to be screened by the staff of Cirikoth. Upon clearing of the interview process, you will be given the `WhiteListed` role and access to the WhiteListed channles within the Cirikoth Discord.

If you don't make the cut during the interview, PLEASE TRY AGAIN! Not everyone can get it there first time, and each of us plays RP differently, so take the time and if you want to, join in and get that new character and story rolling!
#

#### REQUIREMENTS
All players looking to join Cirikoth __MUST__ be interviewed and have __ALL__ of the following ready to go _before_ entering the realm:

- __Medieval Minecraft Skin:__ (This is role-play and you are REQUIRED to have a Minecraft skin that is REALISTIC! No weird, dimensional beings, no modern day clothing, no additional designs that implicate anything othert than "Medieval/Fantasy"
- __Rich Backstory:__ Character WITH a custom, Medieval Based name and lore building their arrival at Cirikoth. For assitance in naming, please see [Fantasy Name Generators](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com) and click on the `Fantasy & Folklore` tab at the top.


------------------------------------------------------
## Features

- Completely re-wires the game; you now LIVE IN CIRIKOTH.
- Jobs to be assigned to become a name in Cirikoth
- Custom currency forged by Blacksmiths for use in the realm
- Crime ran INDIVIDUALLY to the associated town
- Taxes, laws, land... this is a new life.

Nestled in the middle of the Aetherverse, Cirikoth is a quiet realm where economy, industry, and community flourish. Find your new town and take up the mantle that will make your name in Cirikoth; but beware... not all is peaceful. Hardships and struggles find there ways to all, and even in the beautiful land of Cirikoth, many may not be in as bright as spirits as you.

------------------------------------------------------
## Rules

Unfortunately, there are some rules as shitlords do exist. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the rules and guidelines of Cirikoth. If you cannot follow these rules, or have some smart-ass remark, go jump on __FiveM__ and join the your ranks of shit-lords and try-hards... Cirikoth is NOT the place:

**__Cirikoth RP Server Rules & Guidelines__**

As this is a Role-Play server, our rules and guidelines that are more like **commandments** than rules. We take our Role-Play **VERY** seriously here, and would like to keep an environment with lore friendly, background rich experiences within the realm of Cirikoth. Please be sure you are familiar with the Rules & Guidelines before reacting to the roles! Any of these rules found to be broken will result in a **3 day Temp-Ban**, while repeat offenses will be met with a **Perma-Ban**

1. **No God Modding**:
 God modding is when a character features god-like abilities, such as invincibility, mind control, or other unrealistic powers that might not fit with lore. Another form is when your character does something impossible that could kill them.

2. **No Meta Gaming**:
Meta gaming is when a player applies out of charter **(OOC)** retrieved information to their in-character **(IC)**, such as having information that only several in-characters players knows, and you obtained it without having your character there, or by just hearing it from others out of character.

    ```
    Example: A player watches a role-play about a secret item, that only they would know. That said player would enter a role-play with them talking about the items, which he doesn't know of.
    ```

3. __NO SPRINT JUMPING__:
You are not a Kangaroo. Medieval gear and quality-of-life did NOT permit people hopping around like bunny rabbits in a full sprint continually. __DO NOT SPRINT JUMP__. Offenders will be given 2 strikes; first strike is a __Temporary 3-Day Ban__ and the second is a __Perma-Ban__; no one is here to take your shennanigans, and it will not be tolerated for those looking for QUALITY ROLE-PLAY.

3. **No Lore Breaking**:
Lore breaking is when a character breaks lore, which is anything that likely affects a character or scenario. The basis for these commonalities is origin, culture, and known historical events. *Lorebending*, a similar term, is when existing lore is lightly modified (Hence the term lore bending), but not significantly or in a way that detracts from the role-playing experience. Often this has to do with ideas that are neither supported nor contradicted by existing lore.

4.  **No Power Plays**:
Power-playing occurs when a player operates someone's character without the other player's consent. The most blatant example of this would be a player writing, "Your character falls off the cliff when he walks up to it." As you can see, you take active control of what the other character does. Not only is this not fair to the other player, but it's also discouraged because often players will misconstrue the behaviors and personalities of characters they didn't design. Power playing goes into more subtle situations, however.

5.  **No Mary-Sues / Gary-Stus**
A *Mary-Sue / Gary-Stu* is a specific kind of character that has a lot of feats, and no flaws. A Mary-Sue is any character (of any gender, age, race, or species) who fits one or more of these descriptions:

 - A character who’s too perfect, lacking realistic or logical flaws, or whose flaws do not affect them in any ways.
 - A character who’s exactly like their creator, except idealized or made “better”.
 - A character who’s far too powerful, especially whose abilities exceed that which is possible for his/her race in the setting of the story. Particularly if said character has abilities that do not exist within the boundaries of the story’s world. Often these characters are technically legitimate, but are very, "Look at how unique and cool I am!"

6. **Rich Full Backgrounds**
Every player that enters the realm of Cirikoth will go through a screening process. Your characters backstory **MUST** fit the lore of Cirikoth and be something worthwhile for a rich role-play experience.

If you feel comfortable with everything and are ready to start your journey in Cirikoth, react to this message and you will be set to start the in-processing into Cirikoth!

As long as we all keep a fun, enjoyable experience for everyone then **Cirikoth** will be around for awhile. I'll be dipped in liqiud metal if this turns into some GTA V/FiveM bullcrap XD

------------------------------------------------------
## Starting

When you first enter the realm of __Cirikoth__, you will be given your Traveller's gear and __25 Pennigar__, the currency used throughout Cirikoth. You will also start at the __Oakencairn Docks__ where you will be able to begin your adventure and see where your life takes you!

Be sure to refer to the __README__ if you require any assitance, and be sure to open Support Tickets if there are any discrepancies within your __Cirikoth__ experience.

------------------------------------------------------
## Towns and Cities
__Cirikoth__ has 4 major towns _(Oakencairn, Auchenshuggle, Angelhorn, and Moria)_, a myriad of farms, and Angelhorn castle with a private district within the castle walls. And finally there is the __Angelhorn Keep__, where the __Lord and Lady of Angelhorn__ run and watch their city and the realm of Cirikoth.

To begin your adventure, you will need to decide which town you will be a part of! But be sure it will benefit you; the __Jarls & Stewards__ of the towns and cities hire on an as needed basis! Make sure the position is available in that town before you decide on a homestead!

------------------------------------------------------
## Roles & Rankings
__Cirikoth__ has may states of life that citizens may find themselves work towards. Not everyone wants to be a farmer for their life, so work smart and get in good with the right people and you may receive a promotion!

These are the current ranks within Cirikoth, and their respective abilities within the realm:

| Title/Rank | Description and Abilities |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Jarl | The Jarls of Cirikoth are the highest in command, below the High King, and have access to everything in Cirikoth. Doors, chests, commands, laws, rules, decorations, type of toilet paper... the Jarls have all the power and appoint thier Stewards to handle their day-to-day. |
| Steward | The Steward is a DIRECT EXTENSION of their Jarl. The Steward has almost all the same power as a Jarl, but somewhat limited so as to keep ranks somewhat separate. Stewards are the advisors and assistants to the Jarls. | Thegn | The Thegn is the Jarls right-hand of justice. The Thegn is responsible for appointing Guards in the city, mainting the peace within the town/city walls, and making sure the crime is kept to a minimum. |
| Thegns | The Thegns are the heads of security in your town/city. The Guards report to these individuals and all final criminal/security related incident outcomes will end here before they go anyn higher. |
| Guards (Job) | The Guards are the working force behind the peace within the towns/cities of Cirikoth. The Guards can make arrests and free citizens, but answer to the Thegn for any issues or concerns. Limited access to the realm. This is NOT a Role/Rank but more so a Job; it is here due to it's double-agent capabilities. |

All other roles in Cirikoth are considered "citizen" roles and don't receive any special permissions or abilities. They are subject to the laws of the land that they find their residence in, and it is up to them to follow the rules or be handled accordingly.


------------------------------------------------------
## Job Corps
Within __Cirikoth's__ town and cities, industry and economy must thrive, and it is up to the citizens and their Jarl to build booming trade routes that will fuel and feed the towns. This means JOBS!

Each job is payed on a IRL Weekly Basis by the towns Jarl OR Steward, and the amount per week is based off what the Jarl/Steward deem is appropriate. There are a number of jobs available within __Cirikoth__ and based on the availability within each town, the position could be yours:

    - Armorer
    - Alchemist
    - Baker
    - Bank Teller
    - Barkeep
    - Blacksmith
    - Bounty Hunter
    - Brewer
    - Butcher
    - Cook
    - Courier
    - Enchanter
    - Farmer
    - Forestry
    - Guard
    - Henchman _(Security)_
    - Hunter
    - Miner
    - Shop Owner
    - Stable Master
    - Tailor


------------------------------------------------------
## Bank & Funding
__Pennigar__ is the main currency used in Cirikoth, __AND CAN ONLY BE MADE BY BLACKSMITHS APPOINTED BY JARLS__. Pennigar is used as a tangible currency, and therefore must be treated as such.

To handle transactions, you would "throw" the required amount of Pennigar to the player you are paying. If the transaction is __15 pennigar__, you would need to separate 15 Pennogar in your inventory, and then give the 15 stack to the the other player.

Safe keeping your stacks of Pennigar is important, that is why each town will be equipped with a __Bank__. The banks are accessible during the towns business hours, and allows players to Deposit and Withdrawl amounts of Pennigar for safe keeping. This transaction is handled by visiting the bank and giving the teller your funds for saving. The tellers will keep a record of all deposits so that citizens know their pennigar is safe, allowing for a constant and balanced amount of secure pennigar storage in each city. The __Jarls__ will setup their mode of handling within the banks, so make sure you know the deal in your city/town!

Every IRL week, payments __MUST__ be made to vendors and open trade route recipients _(or whatever you have setup with your trader)_. Should this fail repeatedly, you will be informed before being removed of your title!

------------------------------------------------------
## Trade & Economy
As __Cirikoth__ is a Community Driven server, the trade and economy must be established amongst players within the realm! For exmaple,

```
If a Blacksmith wants to continue profiting from creating the currency and other weapons, they will need to find a Miner in another town and setup a Trade Route to keep resources flowing
```

Same with Farmers, Forestry, Barkeeps, etc. The ability to make huge amounts of money is very possible within the realm, but be careful! Sometimes the Jarl may make your weekly payment to them high! Get on your towns Council's good side!


------------------------------------------------------
## Your Home
Your home is your safe-haven, your dojo, and everyone is entitled to one, if they put the work in!

To aquire a home in __Cirikoth__ you have to first find your town. Once you have your town selected, you have to find an available house for sale! Get in touch with the Steward of the town to get the process started, and follow the steps the Jarl has put in place.

When you purchase your home, you will be given specific permission for the __DOOR__ of the home you are purchasing. This ensures that EVERYTHING inside is private and hands off unless you give permission to that player with a specific command.

__KEEP YOUR DOORS CLOSED!!!__ This is how you make sure peeps don;t just wander in and help themselves to all of your stuff!

___What if I have an emergency and need to talk top someone at night?___  
Have no fear! __Cirikoth__ has the ability for you to knock on citizen's doors! Just simply walk up to the door in question, and use the `/knockknock` OR `/knock` command. Whether someone answers or not is the REAL question...


------------------------------------------------------
## Businesses
If you have chosen the path of owning a business in your town, there are a couple things you should know:

    1. Doors MUST remain open during business hours to permit customers to use your services
    2. CLOSE your doors at night when your shop is closed so you can lock up properly (YOUR SHOP IS YOUR HOME)
    3. Make sure you are paying the Jarl if it is required!
    4. Be sure your trade routes are open to keep products and offerings available!

Again, __YOUR SHOP IS YOUR HOME__ as they are all equipped with furnished living spaces above them! Make surte you are taking proper precautions so your stuff remains safe and secure. If you want to _purchase and run a business_, speak to your town's Jarl or Steward about leasing a shop within your walls!


------------------------------------------------------
## Crime
Crime in Cirikoth is __TOWN RUN AND MANAGED__ aside from the basic community server rules, which can be found at the top of this README.

Crime and punishment is handled by each town, and through coordination of each town. Bounties can be placed on players, executions are a thing, dungeons and prison can happen... CRIME IS REAL.


------------------------------------------------------
## Proximity Chat

Currently, Cirikoth has a built in **Proximity Chat** feature that will allow you to ONLY communicate via the chat with individuals that are near you. Should a player be near you and you send out a message of, "Hello?" -- that player will only see it if they are within a specific range. Be sure to use this!

**UPDATE ::**
> We have Voice Chat Proximity via Discord built into the server! The Discord will have all the information you need on getting setup properly.


------------------------------------------------------
## Death

>> "Inevitably, you will die... but that is a sacrifice, I am willing to make"  
>> -- Lord Farquad

These things happen, but don't worry! It is not the end. Well, not completely... When you are slip slowly into the void, your energy is transferred to the __Aether__, where it will be summoned back by the forces of Cirikoth to either the realm's port in __Oakencairn__, or to your home should you have a home or room with a bed.


------------------------------------------------------
